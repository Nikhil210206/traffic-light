# 🚦 Traffic Light Detection using OpenCV & Python

A real-time **Traffic Light Detection System** built with Python and OpenCV.  
This project identifies the state of traffic lights (🔴 Red, 🟡 Yellow, 🟢 Green) using **HSV color segmentation** and bounding box annotations.

---

## ✨ Features
- Real-time traffic light detection from **webcam** or **video file**.
- Uses **HSV color space** for robust color-based segmentation.
- Bounding boxes & labels (`Red`, `Yellow`, `Green`) drawn on live feed.
- Works with **images, videos, and live camera feed**.
- Lightweight, no deep learning model required.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenCV** (video & image processing)
- **NumPy** (matrix operations)
- **HSV Color Space**
